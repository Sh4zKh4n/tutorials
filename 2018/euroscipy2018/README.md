# EuroSciPy 2018 - Matplotlib Tutorial

This is a matplotlib tutorial for beginners. Here we will learn how to:
 * use the `plot()` function to create general plots.
 * create multiple plots in the same window, and also in separated windows.
 * add legends in our plots, using the function `legend()`.
 * check how to create different kinds of plots, like bars, histograms, scatterplots, and contours.
