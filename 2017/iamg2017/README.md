# IAMG 2017 - Image Processing using Python

This is a hands-on course on digital image processing using the open
source package scikit-image, an image processing library with algorithms
and utilities for use in research, education and industry. It is developed
by an active, international team of collaborators, providing a
well-documented system based in the Python programming language. Applications
of each topic will be given using optical microscopic images.
